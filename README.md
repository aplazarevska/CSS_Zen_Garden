# Zen Garden

A basic CSS challenge to customise the [Zen Garden Webpage](http://www.csszengarden.com/).

## Description

I was provided with the Zen Garden's CSS default style v1.02, and the default HTML code, and required to make necessary changes to improve its style. Only the .css file was to be modified, without touching the .html file. And mostly CSS 1 & 2 was to be used. Also, responsible design was to be taken into consideration. 

This was a more individual challenge than the previous HTML and CSS challenges.
